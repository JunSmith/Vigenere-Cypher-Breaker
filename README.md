# Vigenere RMI Cypher Breaker
*By Jun Smith*

Distributed Systems module assignment for Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology Software Development and Program Design course.

## To Run
- Place cracker.war in (Apache Tomcat)/webapps directory. The targeted version of this project is Tomcat 8 and is not guaranteed to work with any other version (nor this one).
Keep in mind WarAndPeace-Tolstoy.txt needs to be in either in the same or one level above the .jar file directory wise.
- Use a web browser of your choice and type localhost:8080/cracker. Enter a sequence of letters and specify a key length and the service should return a decyphered version of
the entered text for you.
